# spheredeformation
In this project, I create a sphere mesh out of nothing with code. I do this by creating a octahedron and creating triangles in each side, then I pop them to the outside, by subtracting the a vertice position of the transform.position of the mesh and normalizing that * the radius of the sphere.
